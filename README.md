## Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Clone the Project Repository

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Select **Get from VCS** on the Welcome Screen.
3. Paste the Git repository URL into the URL field.
4. Click **Clone** and load Maven dependencies.

### Step 2: Configure the Backend

1. Navigate to the `application.properties` file in the backend directory.
2. Update the database configuration:
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/auth
   spring.datasource.username=<your-username>
   spring.datasource.password=<your-password>
   spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
   Replace <your-username> and <your-password> with your MySQL credential
   ```

### Step 3: Run the Backend Server

Click the Run button in IntelliJ IDEA.

Verify that the server starts at http://localhost:8080.

Insert roles into the roles table:
INSERT INTO roles (id, name) VALUES  
(1, 'ADMIN'),  
(2, 'COACH'),  
(3, 'ATHLETE');

### Step 4: View the Frontend Pages

Open the frontend directory.
Locate the starting HTML file, e.g., welcome.html.
Open the file in your browser.

### Step 5: Test the API Endpoints

Login API:
POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login  
Body:  
{  
 "email": "testemail",  
 "password": "testpassword"  
}

Registration API:

POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/register  
Body:  
{  
 "name": "your name",  
 "email": "user email",  
 "password": "newpassword",  
 "role": "select role"  
}

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

Backend Server Fails to Start:

Verify database credentials in application.properties.
Ensure MySQL Server is running.
Frontend Pages Not Loading:

Verify Node.js installation.
Ensure the backend server is running.
API Calls Failing in Postman:

Check if the backend server is running at http://localhost:8080.
Include the JWT token in the Authorization header.

### Table Scripts

-- Create 'user' table
CREATE TABLE user (
id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE roles (
id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
name ENUM('ADMIN', 'COACH', 'ATHLETE') NOT NULL
);

-- Create 'user_roles' table
CREATE TABLE user_roles (
id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
user_id INT NOT NULL,
roles_id INT NOT NULL,
FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES user (id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
FOREIGN KEY (roles_id) REFERENCES roles (id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

-- Create 'events' table
CREATE TABLE events (
id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
category VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
event_date DATE NOT NULL,
event_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
image_link VARCHAR(255),
meet VARCHAR(255)
);

-- Create 'registrations' table
CREATE TABLE registrations (
id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
event_id INT NOT NULL,
user_id INT NOT NULL,
FOREIGN KEY (event_id) REFERENCES events (id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES user (id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

-- Insert default roles
INSERT INTO roles (id, name) VALUES
(1, 'ADMIN'),
(2, 'COACH'),
(3, 'ATHLETE');

### How to Use:

Execute these scripts in MySQL Workbench or any MySQL client.
Ensure the auth database exists before running these scripts, or create it using:
CREATE DATABASE auth;
USE auth;
